\## 🛡️ Task-02: Image Encryption-Decryption Tool (Cybersecurity Track)



This project implements a basic image encryption and decryption system using pixel manipulation in Python.



---



\## 💡 How it Works



\- The tool uses a simple XOR operation on each pixel.

\- XOR is reversible — the same key used to encrypt can decrypt.

\- Works with common formats like `.png`, `.jpg`, etc.



---



\## ⚙️ Features



\- 🔒 Encrypt image using a numeric key (1–255)

\- 🔓 Decrypt image using the same key

\- Preserves original format and resolution

\- Fast and lightweight



---



\## 🖼️ Sample Usage



```bash

python image\_cipher.py
